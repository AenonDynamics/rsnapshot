Testcases
===========================

You may be confused because the "new" testcases are written in javascript/nodejs but this is much easier than using Perl.

* We want to test `rsnapshot` behaviour
* We won't test internal rsnapshot perl functions
* The testcases are no classic "unit tests" which tests single functions of the programm
* We want to used a bullet proofed testing-framework - [mocha](https://mochajs.org/)
